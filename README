QDYN is a Fortran 95 code with a Matlab wrapper
to compute quasi-dynamic earthquake cycles 
on faults embedded in a 2D or 3D elastic medium
and on spring-block systems
governed by rate-and-state friction.

To get started:
	Open Matlab
	Add the qdyn directory to your path (addpath ...)
	Type 'help qdyn'
	Read the usage instructions

Examples are provided in the directory "examples".
Complete information is provided in the manual doc/QDYN_man_GIT.pdf.
